## Reading Assignment 
  
Read "Improving the Interpretation of Fixed Effects Regression Results" by Mummolo and Peterson. The reading is available online [here](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/jmummolo/files/improving_the_interpretation_of_fixed_effects_regression_results.pdf) and is also on bCourses in the Readings folder. 

All the questions in this checkpoint can be answered based on the article. 

## Questions 

### What is the substantive choice that researchers make when using fixed effects? 



### Why should researchers avoid discussing effects of changes of a variable that are larger than any observed change in the data? 



### What is the problem with Snyder and Str√∂mberg (2010) consider a 0-to-1 shift in the their treatment when discussing its impact on the probability that an indviduals recalls the name of their member of Congress?


### How should a research go about identifying a plausible counterfact shift in a treatment effect given the data?
