\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\subsection{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course will focus on the practical application of research methods
for political science. In this course, we will take on two major tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How can we implement standard research designs found in political
  science research? The research aims of scholars are varied, but all
  research requires a strong research design. This class will examine
  several topics in research design and causal inference, emphasizing
  how to implement these techniques in practice.
\item
  How can we communicate our results so that others can reproduce what
  we have done? Successful research programs rely on the ability of
  others to scrutinize claims. This course will cover methods to explain
  our results to others in a transparent manner and strategies for
  visualizing research results.
\end{enumerate}

By the end of the course, students will feel comfortable with the
foundational tools of causal inference. They will also learn how to code
these techniques in their research.

\hypertarget{objectives}{%
\subsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

By the end of this course, students should be able to meet the following
conceptual objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Describe the essential elements of and primary threats to causal
  inference and identify how these threats could change the conclusion
  of a research project.
\item
  Demonstrate the ability to evaluate the credibility of a modern
  empirical paper's research design.
\item
  Demonstrate competence in writing code to replicate core research
  designs.
\end{itemize}

This course heavily makes use of R to implement all of the topics that
we discuss. That said, this is not a computer science or data science
course. We recognize that not everyone has the same programming
background or familiarity with R. The course is designed to be as
self-contained as possible. The use of code is to solidify our
understanding of conceptual topics. That means if you have never
programmed before, we will teach you what you need to be successful in
this course. We hope that this class will make you excited to further
expand your skills on your own or through future coursework.

Each conceptual topic in class will be paired with computational
implementation by students. By the end of the semester, students will be
able to meet the following computational objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Demonstrate familiarity working with common data structures (such as a
  data frame or a matrix) in R.
\item
  Demonstrate the capability to implement different research designs
  using simulated and actual data in R.
\item
  Demonstrate understanding of typical data wrangling workflows in R for
  research projects.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\subsection{Grading}\label{grading}}

Grades in this course are earned by \textbf{demonstrating evidence of
skill on the main concepts in the course} and showing appropriate
engagement throughout the semester. Students demonstrate evidence of
skill by completing the assignments outlined here at a reasonably high
level of quality.

Your instructor has long been flummoxed by the fact that learning comes
through mistakes, but most course grading systems do not allow for
errors. Your instructor has also observed that such a state of affairs
means that students often avoid challenging themselves because doing so
usually results in a lower grade than playing it safe.

To that end, evaluation in this course is likely different from other
courses you have had at Berkeley. In our class, \textbf{there are no
points} on any items. Instead, we will evaluate the work you turn in
against rubric standards made clear for each assignment. If work meets
the standard, that work gets full credit. If work does not meet the
standard, the student will receive clear feedback from the instructors
and, unless specified otherwise, the chance to reflect on that feedback,
revise your work, and then resubmit the assignment for re-grading.

We assume, and frankly hope, that students make mistakes because only
through making mistakes, reflecting on those mistakes, and then
correcting them do we learn. We learn new skills, retain that
information, and transfer what we know to new domains through deliberate
effort. Therefore, \textbf{students can make mistakes without penalty}
as long as they eventually demonstrate evidence of the evaluated skill.
\newpage Assignments in this course as marked as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Assignment & Marks \\
\midrule
\endhead
Weekly Practice & EMRN \\
Problem Sets & EMRN \\
Check-ins & P/NP \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The criteria for each mark are explained in
\protect\hyperlink{evaluation}{Evaluation Schemes}. If any of this
changes during the course, I will do it to favor students.

The following table determines students' final grades for the course.
Grades are given for the highest grade level for which \emph{all} the
requirements in a row of the table have been met or exceeded. In other
words, to earn a grade, a student needs to meet \emph{all} the
requirements in the row for that grade.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Grade & Weekly Practice & Problem Sets & Check-ins (P) \\
\midrule
\endhead
A & 10 + with at least 7 E & 5 (\(\geq 3 E\)) & 13 \\
B & 9 with at least 5 E & 4 & 10 \\
C & 8 & 3 & 7 \\
D & 5 & 2 & 5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A grade of F is given if \emph{none} of the rows have been fully
completed.

Plus/Minus grades within grade bands will be assigned at the
instructor's discretion based on how close a student is to the next
highest grade level. For students concerned about this at the outset of
the semester, the best way to get the next half grade up is to show up
and put forth a good-faith effort. Students that make other students'
experiences better will be rewarded.

\hypertarget{work-revision-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Work Revision Policy}\label{work-revision-policy}}

The revision must be turned back in with seven days of receiving an
initial grade for all work revision eligible assignments. Work revisions
will be specific to the assignment. This includes the number of total
resubmits allowed. In general, P/NP assignments will require students to
submit a self-assessment with corrected solutions and explanations for
each problem that they missed. In general, EMRN work will require the
same self-assessment as before and that the student solve a new but
similar type of problem that the student missed. For section
assignments, the same holds true, except that students can choose to
submit individually or as a team.

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Evaluation Schemes}\label{evaluation}}

There are two grading schemes in this class.

\hypertarget{emrn}{%
\subsubsection{EMRN}\label{emrn}}

All assignments with EMRN grading have individual rubrics for acceptable
work. EMRN grading follows the flowchart below.

\includegraphics{grades/EMRN.png}

EMRN assignments are not eligible for revision if the work demonstrates
clearly insufficient effort or if the work misses a deadline. Students
are welcome to clarify with the instructor what clearly insufficient
effort looks like if they are unsure.

\hypertarget{pnp}{%
\subsubsection{P/NP}\label{pnp}}

A Passing grade (P) is given if the work is turned in by its deadline
and if each part of the assignment has a response and the responses are
correct. A No Pass (NP) is given if some part of the assignment is
incorrect. P/NP assignments are not eligible for revision if the work
demonstrates clearly insufficient effort or if the work misses a
deadline. Students are welcome to clarify with the instructor what
clearly insufficient effort looks like if they are unsure.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\subsection{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsubsection{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

While conceptually possible to do well in this course without attending
a single meeting, it is highly improbable. Students should plan to
attend all classes and participate actively in each class meeting to get
the most out of the course. Attendance will be noted but not graded.
Students with an excessive number of absences will struggle to get a
good grade in this class.

\hypertarget{religious-observances}{%
\subsubsection{Religious Observances}\label{religious-observances}}

This fall has a large number of religious holidays. If you plan to
observe a religious holiday, even if it is not typically one in the
course schedule, please see me as soon as possible.

\hypertarget{deadlines}{%
\subsubsection{Deadlines}\label{deadlines}}

As stated policy: Deadlines are strictly enforced absent a University
exception. We will not accept late work in part because of the revision
policy stated above.

As subtext: students have many legitimate exceptions for completing an
assignment on time that may not be a University exception. Suppose a
student believes they qualify for an exemption on an assignment. In that
case, it is the student's responsibility to reach out to the instructor
ASAP (preferably far before the deadline) to discuss. Exemptions in this
regard are granted on a case-by-case basis.

\hypertarget{academic-success}{%
\subsubsection{Academic Success}\label{academic-success}}

My goal for this class is to help each student get the grade they want
to earn in this class. I firmly believe that all students are capable of
high achievement, but I will respect each student's choice in the level
of effort they choose to exert in my class. If there is something that a
student needs to succeed, please let me know in a format that feels
comfortable to you.

\hypertarget{email-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Email Policy}\label{email-policy}}

I will endeavor to answer all emails within 72 hours. If I have not
responded to an email in that interval, please send me a follow-up
email. If your query is answered in this syllabus, my reply will simply
direct you to the syllabus.

Students often send email communication that is overly formal or
unnecessarily informal. In the spirit of unsolicited advice for
communicating with your instructors, when in doubt, use the email
template below:

Dear \emph{Professor X}/\emph{How the person you're emailing you
instructs you to begin salutations},

\emph{Insert line recognizing our common existence if you so choose}

\emph{One sentence specifying what class you're in and section if
relevant}. \emph{Insert your specific question here}. \emph{Insert a
sentence indicating what resources you've consulted if the question is
administrative}.

\emph{Insert a sentence letting me know what action you'd like me to
take}.

\emph{Some form of salutation. Best and/or Thanks tend to be the norm.}
\emph{Insert your name as you'd prefer to be called.}

An example of this template in action:

\emph{Dear Professor X},

\emph{I hope this email finds you well.}

\emph{I'm in PSXXX Section 1. Would you be willing to write me a letter
of recommendation for a scholarship opportunity on campus? I consulted
the syllabus and did not see if you had a specific policy about letters
of rec.}

\emph{Could you please let me know if you are willing to do so, and if
so, what information I will need to provide.}

\emph{Thanks,}

\emph{{[}Your name{]}}

\hypertarget{office-hours}{%
\subsubsection{Office Hours}\label{office-hours}}

Office hours are a chance for students to engage one-on-one or in
smaller groups with the professor or GSI. Students can use this time to
clarify class materials, ask questions about challenging parts of the
course or inquire about future opportunities such as graduate schools,
jobs, or internships. While not causal, your instructor has observed a
strong positive correlation between students who regularly attend office
hours and academic success. To get the most out of office hours, consult
the link
\href{https://lsc.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/What-Are-Office-Hours.pdf}{here}.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsubsection{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Students are expected to know and abide by the University's policies on
Academic Integrity. Should a student be uncertain about this policy,
consult university resources. Any cases of documented plagiarism will
result in a failing grade for the course.

\hypertarget{academic-accomodations}{%
\subsubsection{Academic Accomodations}\label{academic-accomodations}}

We are committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs
of all students. Students who have or think they may have a disability
can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to request an
official accommodation. DSP (dsp.berkeley.edu) is the campus office
responsible for authorizing disability-related accommodations. DSP's
on-campus office is located at 260 César Chávez Student Center.

Please see me as soon as possible for all other accommodation questions.

Berkeley offers additional student resources for students needing
additional support. See the links below:
